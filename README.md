## CVE-2015-5090
Adobe Reader/Acrobat Pro privilege escalation in <= 11.0.10.

## CVE-2018-11072
Dell Digital Delivery LPE. Using the PoC, you'll need to drop a DLL under the appropriate entitlement folder in %ProgramData%. The included PoC simply triggers the entitlement reinstallation (see ExampleProject project in the solution). Note I use SharpNeedle project to do the code injection, and had to hack around a few bugs.
